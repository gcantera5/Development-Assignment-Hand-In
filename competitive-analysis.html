                            I noticed that Spotify and Apple Music had many similarities in terms of which factors were available. 
                            Both offered many different sorting and filtering options. However, one distinct difference was that I found Spotify’s
                            way of offering these options on their interface were easier to find and use than Apple’s. 
                            Compared to the other two, Sound Cloud lacked a plethora of factors. The interface was not as clean as the others and 
                            seemed more outdated.

                        <li> 
                            The factors that I found the most useful were the filtering by favorite songs and albums. Here, a user can easily opt to listen
                            to the songs they actually like and filtering by album allows one to listen to the artist that they like who offers “similar sounding” 
                            song aesthetics. The filter that I personally found to be the least successful was the filtering by custom order one. When you are doing 
                            a custom order filter you are essentially just queuing the songs that you want to listen to in that particular order and queuing songs is 
                            already a feature that exists. To me, it just seems like a redundant function.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </div>
            <p>What I want to implement</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            When implementing my own list based interface, I want to make sure that my filtering and sorting factors are ones
                            that my users will actually want to use such as filtering my favorite songs, duration, and by album. These seem to be 
                            the most popular ones across all different music streaming platforms so I want to be sure to implement those as well. 
                        </li>

                        <li> 
                            As mentioned before, when I implement these factors, I want to make sure that they are being grouped correctly. 
                            If I am filtering by album, I want them to be filtered alphabetically by artist. As for favorite songs, I think that as 
                            long as they are in the correct category of “favorites” it does not matter the order they appear in when filtering by such.
