                        <li> We were asked to schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024. In modifying the
                            original design, I wanted to alter the not only how the appointment options were presented but also the color of the associated buttons.
                            By doing this, I would be utilizing color to improve visual hierarchy and enhance user engagement, assuming my user does not have visual impairments.
