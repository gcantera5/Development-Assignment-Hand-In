            <p>Overview</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li> In this assignment, I was tasked to redesign an online scheduling system and collect data to compare my modified design against the original. To do this, I utilized hypothesis testing and drawings from statistically significant analysis.</li>
                        <li> We ran an A/B test on two different UI designs and analyzed the results from our findings.</li>
                        <li> We used the results to draw conclusions on the effects of alternate design choice and the impact it has on a user's interaction</li>
                        <li> We performed the target interaction on a class designated machine (version A), modified version B to test a design change from version A, and finally we performed target interactions on ~30 different version B's.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <p>What is A/B Testing?</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li> A/B testing is responisble for comparing two versions of a product via user testing to figure out which one preforms better.</li>
                        <li> A refers to the control/original interface. Whereas B refers to the variation of the original platform. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <p>What is the overarching question you are attempting to prove/disprove?</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li> We are attempting to prove how visual changes to a design impacts metrics such as misclick rates, time spent on a page, and more.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <p>How is A/B Testing useful?</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li> A/B testing allows engineers to critically analyze data-driven decisions about changes made to a design.</li>
                        <li> Allows us to collect quantitative data to compare between the two variations.</li>
                        <li> A/B is an opportunity to collect user feedback to further enhance the user experience.</li>
                        <li> We can extrapolate meaningful insights from our results, drawing conclusions based on statistically significant data.</li>
                    </ul>
