                        <li> A one-tailed t-test is appropriate to use when one expects one group to be greater or lesser than the other. For this metric, we opted for a one-tail t-test because I hypothesize the misclick rate of Version A to be greater than Version B. </li>
                        <li> P-value represents the probability of observing if the null hypothesis is true. A p-value less than the significance level (typically 0.05) means you reject the null hypothesisis. 
                             The p-value for a t-statistic of 2.924988129 for a one-tailed test is 0.00309 (1 - 0.9969066735). The p-value is less than 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis and have found statistically significant evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true.</li>
                        <li> Other important findings that were revealed from this analysis can be seen through the averages of both verions where Verion A had an average misclick rate of 0.2058823529 whereas Version's B was 0. This tells us there were no misclicks on Version B but some on Version A.</li>

                        <li> Using what we know about p-values from above, the p-value for a t-statistic of 2.013074381 for a one-tailed test is 0.02481 (1 - 0.9751880081). The p-value is less than 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis and have found statistically significant evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true.</li>
                        <li> Other important findings that were revealed from this analysis can be seen through the averages of Verion A and Version's B time spent on a page. The average for Version A was 12860.44 milliseconds whereas Version B had an average of 8258.74 milliseconds. From these averages alone, we 
                             can see that a user spends more time on Version A's page than they do on Version B's.

                        <p> Overall, we collected about an equal amount of data points for Version A and Version B with 33 vs 30 entries respectively. It is evident from our results that Version B performs better than Version A in terms of misclick rates, time spent on page rates, and based on the time it takes to make a first click rates. 
                            Version B had proven to be the more efficient variation of this website.
