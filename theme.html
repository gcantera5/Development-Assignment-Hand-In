                            The theme I chose was a music streaming platform. The reason I chose this theme is because at the beginning of the semester, 
                            my figma project was a mockup of Spotify and I wanted music to be the theme of my projects this semester. Seeing that we had 
                            to incorporate lists and aggregators for this assignment, I saw the perfect opportunity to choose music yet again.

                            The I want to incorporate filter sort and aggregation in the following ways:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Filter: by artist, by album
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Sort : by duration 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Aggregate: how long a users “listen to” list is
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
