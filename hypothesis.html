                    <i>A boolean flag indicating if the user pushed a button external to the task.</i>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            H<sub>0</sub>: There is no significant difference between Verson A and Verson B's misclick rate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            H<sub>1</sub>: Version B will have a lower misclick rate than Version A.
                        </p>
                        <li> In Version A, the colors of all the buttons are the same and there is no divider betwween the slots so it is difficult to tell the difference between all the appointment availabilities. As a result, I predict there will be a higher rate of misclicks.
                             In my modified version, there is a clear distinciton between not only the different appointment slots but also with the buttons. In version B, I have divided the appointments with a horizontal line and made
                             the button I want the user to click on a pink color that is very distinct from the rest of the gray colored ones. That is why I predict Version B will have a lower misclick rate due to the color distincitons. With this information in mind,
                             I believe that we will end up <i>rejecting</i> the null hypothesis.

            <p>Time Spent On Page Hypothesis</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <i>Total time (in milliseconds) that the user spent on the page.</i>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            H<sub>0</sub>: There is no significant difference in the amount of time a user spends viewing Version A compared to Version B.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            H<sub>1</sub>: Users will spend a greater amount of time viewing Version A compared to Version B.
                        </p>
                        <li> As mentioned above, there is no clear distinciton between the various appointment options in Version A. In Version B, a user can scan through the divided option slots and use color heiarchy
                             to help them quickly distinguish which appointment they intend to chose. That is why I believe that Version A users will spend more time looking at the screen than they do with Version B. 
                             With this information in mind, I believe that we will end up <i>rejecting</i> the null hypothesis.

                    <i>The time (in milliseconds) it took for the user to execute his/her first click</i>

                        <p>
                            H<sub>0</sub>: There will be no difference in the time taken to make the first click between Version A and Version B.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            H<sub>1</sub>: Users will spend more time to make their first click on Version A compared to Version B. 
                        </p>
                        <li> I have made the correct appointment slot I intend users to click on a different color than the rest of the options. In version A they are all the same color but in B, the option to schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024
                             is in a bright pink color that stands out from the rest. That is why I believe that users will spend more time making their first click with Version A than they do with Version B.
                             With this information in mind, I believe that we will end up <i>rejecting</i> the null hypothesis.
